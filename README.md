Analyzing the Public Reaction to Controversial Art: A Study of Lil Nas X's Montero Era

With the prominent shift that social media platforms have taken over the course of the 
past years from a means of communication and connection to a battlefield for public 
debate, there has been witnessed a significant spread of hate speech. This research project
aims to provide a quantitative analysis on the public’s reaction to art that is controversial. 
The study entails performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data collected from the 
timespan during which Lil Nas X, a black gay artist, started his Montero album era, which 
spanned over the course of several months in 2021 and included performances, 
merchandise, and the release of several videos. XLNet, an advanced classification model
is applied to twitter users to study the public reaction to his “controversial” art and analyse 
the degree of hate that these users portrayed. The dispersion of these hate tweets is also 
depicted across different regions of the world to observe the different reactions from 
metrics of homophobia, racism, and extreme conservatism.
